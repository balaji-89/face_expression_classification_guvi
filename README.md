# **Facial Expression Recognition**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based model for recognizing facial expressions. The model is trained on grayscale images of size 48x48, representing 7 distinct emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**. The project aims to achieve accurate emotion classification while maintaining efficiency, leveraging hyperparameter tuning and GPU acceleration.

---

## **Features**
- **Input Size**: 48x48 grayscale images.
- **Architecture**: Custom CNN with optimized hyperparameters.
- **Emotions Recognized**:
  - Angry
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Surprise
  - Neutral
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy (Top-1, Top-2)
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Loss
  - Confusion Matrix
- **Callbacks Used**:
  - Early Stopping
  - Learning Rate Scheduler
  - Model Checkpointing

---

## **Dataset**
- **Train Dataset**: Images categorized into folders named after emotions.
- **Test Dataset**: Similar folder structure for evaluation.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Images are resized to 48x48 and converted to grayscale.
  - Data augmentation applied: random horizontal flips.

---

## **Model Architecture**
The final architecture optimized via hyperparameter tuning:
1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - 3 layers with filters increasing progressively (75, 125, 256).
2. **Pooling**: MaxPooling layers after each convolutional layer.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Dense layers with sizes 260, 128, 64, and 32.
4. **Output Layer**:
   - A Dense layer with 7 neurons and `softmax` activation for classification.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-expression-recognition.git
   cd facial-expression-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Organize images into folders for each emotion.
   - Ensure images are in grayscale or preprocess them using the provided scripts.
   
2. **Training the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Model**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Inference**:
   To classify a single image:
   ```python
   from inference import predict_expression
   result = predict_expression("path_to_image.jpg")
   print(result)
   ```

---

## **Results**
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: 54.13%
- **Top-2 Accuracy**: 76.23%
- **Precision**: 54.34%
- **Recall**: 54.45%
- **F1 Score**: 53.0%

---

## **Callbacks Used**
- **Early Stopping**: Monitors validation loss and stops training when no improvement is observed for 5 epochs.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Saves the model with the best validation accuracy.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Adjusts learning rate dynamically during training.

## **Future Improvements**
- Experiment with transfer learning (e.g., using pretrained models like VGG or ResNet).
- Add more robust data augmentation techniques.
- Implement real-time emotion detection using webcam input.
- Explore multi-task learning to predict other face attributes (e.g., age or gender) alongside emotions.
